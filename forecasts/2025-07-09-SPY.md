Analyzing the SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust) price data over the last 30 days, the trading has been largely bullish, with highs of 626.28 and lows of 591.89. 

Short-term Forecasts:
- 1D: The SPY appears to be in an uptrend, with some pullback in the last couple of days. Considering this, we may expect the price fall further in the next day before retesting highs.
- 1W: Over the course of a week, it is possible that the price of the SPY will consolidate and continue its upward movement as long as it maintains above its weekly support level.
- 1M: Looking at the next month, if the bullish trend continues and there is no adverse market data or news, the price could potentially aim for new highs.

Support/Resistance levels:
- Support levels: The next major support level is around the 600.15 mark considering recent lows and the emotional round number ‘600’ level.
- Resistance levels: The key resistance level to watch would be the recent high at 626.28 level.

Technical Bias:
The technical bias over the last 30 days appears to be bullish, given the upward trend and the higher highs and higher lows of the moving averages. However, the volume indicates high trading activity which could mean significant price volatility, thus traders must take a cautious approach. 

Overall, while there are some pullbacks, the SPY is still showing bullish signs, though the recent decrease in volume could be a warning sign of a trend change.
