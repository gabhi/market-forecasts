# COIN Forecast â€“ 2025-07-09

Based on the 30-day trading data, COIN has shown considerable fluctuations between lows around 235.29 and highs nearing 382.00. It's clear that there's been volatility in the market, likely fueled by news or macro events occurring concurrently.

Short-Term Forecast:
- 1D: After a recent fall in price, there may be signs of a bounce back. We could see a rise close to the 264-268 levels, provided the stock holds above its latest low around 242.71.
- 1W: On a weekly basis, there's potential for the price to range around its current levels with no apparent strong momentum for a clear uptrend or downtrend.
- 1M: Over the month, given the recent high volatility, the price could reach anywhere between the last month's highs and lows, i.e., around 235.29 at its lowest and 382.00 as its peak.

Support/Resistance Levels:
- The immediate support level is around the recent low of 242.71, with the next support level way down around the 30-day low of 235.29.
- The first resistance level can be found near the recent high around 264.00. Beyond that, the next significant resistance level is likely around the 30-day high of 382.00.

Technical Bias:
Given the recent lows and the general volatile trend, the current bias is slightly bearish with the potential for a bounce back in the coming sessions. However, high fluctuations mean the trend might reverse quickly either way. Investors may want to watch for any sharp movements or breakouts beyond support or resistance levels as an indication of a new trend.
